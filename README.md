# zhuffman-code-challenge
Submission for Java coding challenge

***Specifications***

Create an application that uses a class that implements the provided interface. There are three functions that need to be implemented in the interface. The purpose of this interface is to supply different list sorting functionality. You may not import java.util.Arrays in your submission. All logic must be written by you using basic data types and structures only

    • You must receive the list you are operating on from the user in some way.
    • simpleSort takes a list of numbers and sorts them into ascending order. If specified, the list can also be sorted descending.
    • printSortedFrequency takes a list of numbers and prints them in ascending order to standard out along with the number of times that integer appears in the list.
    • numberOfUniqueValues takes a list of numbers and returns the number of times a unique value appears.


***How to Run***

To run the program, download "IntListAnalyzer.jar" and "welcome.txt" from the IntListAnalyzer folder on the home page of repository. Move these files to your desktop. Open to your desktop in CMD prompt and use following command to execute the .jar file:

java -jar IntListAnalyzer.jar

*When using the program, it will ask you to hit enter to transition screens :)

**If this does not work, please try downloading "IntListAnalyzerV2.jar" instead. This jar file was compiled using compliency with earlier versions of the JRE.
